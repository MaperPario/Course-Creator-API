# [Course Creator API](https://jackson-hagin-portfolio.herokuapp.com/projects/7)

*An application for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.*

**In order for this to run successfully, it has to have a connection to the "Course Creator Client" repository.
Clone that repo, npm install, npm start. The client will be running on localhost:3000.**

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`

Make sure you run 'npm install' on both the client and api
in order to get the proper dependencies installed before
running 'npm start'

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Launch the application and go to http://localhost:5000/ to make sure the app is working properly. You should see a “Welcome to the REST API project!” message.

Recommended to use Postman for operation:
